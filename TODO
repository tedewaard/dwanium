I can query dell faster by dividing the PCs in half and then creating a thread
for each.

Need to figure out how to handle dell and tanium tokens. Use a config file or
environment variables?

Proper logging

Run on a schedule that can check for new PCs
    Adds PCs into DB and then could check if the DB is missing any end dates
    Then query Dell for just those PCs
