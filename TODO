Loop over all the entitlements and just get the latest date and display that one as the warranty.

I can query dell faster by dividing the PCs in half and then creating a thread
for each.

Surpress the database dublicate message or send it to log

Proper logging

Run on a schedule that can check for new PCs
    Adds PCs into DB and then could check if the DB is missing any end dates
    Then query Dell for just those PCs

Could use flags when running to say whether it's first full run or incremental
Or could check for that first in the main loop and see if there is data in the db.

How do I actually want to host this? Check into different AWS options.

Need to setup docker file for DB config

Implement tests

Check for duplicates before inserting into Database. Then I should be able to do 
larger sql updates instead of one at a time
